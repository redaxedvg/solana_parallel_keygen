# solana_parallel_keygen
This repository contains a high-performance Solana keypair generator that leverages parallel processing for faster keypair generation. The program is designed to quickly generate keypairs that match a desired prefix by utilizing parallel execution, which speeds up the process significantly compared to sequential generation.
